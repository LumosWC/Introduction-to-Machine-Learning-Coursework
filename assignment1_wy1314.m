%This is the overall main where I put every single matlab script in the one
%main function as requested.
%Since this is what requested in the Instruction.
%Running this main will indeed provide all the plots required in the
%solutions with the question number on the title of each of them
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%-------The approximated running time for this code is around 15min-----
%-------Please be patient!!!!-----------------------------------
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



%!!!!!!!!!However, I strongly recommend you to run the each main file separately.
%!!!!!!!!!!!There are main_3a,main_3b,main_3c in the code folder as well.
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


%Another add-on: in main_3b, 
%'problem3b3' and'problem3b4_pointpointpoint1'
%take much longer than the rest of other
%codes. If you encounter some bugs, please comment these two out, and the
%rest of plots will pop well out.
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

%Thank you very much for marking!
